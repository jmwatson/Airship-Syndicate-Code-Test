# Airship-Syndicate-Code-Test

This contains my solution to the code test for Airship Syndicate's code test

I ran python and flask in a docker devcontainer from vscode, but you should be able to run this code in your custom setup as well. I ran and tested my code with python 3.11 with flask installed.
